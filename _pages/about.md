Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University advised by <a href='https://ncclab.princeton.edu/'>Jonathan D. Cohen</a>. My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and cognitive neuroscience, taking inspiration from the mechanisms that identify human intelligence and develop neural network models that can demonstrate systematic generalization in abstract reasoning. Last two summers, I interned at Microsoft Research, New York under <a href='https://www.momen-nejad.org/'>Ida Momennejad</a>, where I developed a modular and multi-agentic architecture using large language models for improved planning performance. I also worked on a few projects with <a href='https://pni.princeton.edu/people/h-sebastian-seung'>Sebastian Seung</a> and <a href='https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/tom.php'>Tom Griffiths</a>. Before this, I was an undergrad at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur where I worked with <a href='http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~debdoot/'>Debdoot Sheet</a> at the intersection of deep learning and biomedical imaging. During my undergrad, I also interned at Adobe Research, Bangalore under <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/subratamitraweb/'>Subrata Mitra</a>, where I developed a deep reinforcement learning based scheduler to improve resource utilization and application performance.
